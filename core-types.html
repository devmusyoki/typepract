Typescript type system only helps you during development(before the code gets compiled)

JS uses "dynamic types"(resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types"(set during development)

Typescript has type inference - whereby TS tries its best to understand which type of variable it has  

CORE TYPES -
 -Number
 - Strings
- Booleans
-objects
-Array
- Tuple - Fixed length array - should have exactly two elements
Enum = enum{NEW, OLD} = added by Typescript: Automatically enumerated globabl contant identifiers
